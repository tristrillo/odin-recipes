This is my first project in my venture as an aspiring Web Developer!

In this project, I was tasked on making recipe pages for some of my favorite dishes. 

This project was done purely with HTML. Once I've learned CSS, I will come back to this project and apply some of what I learned to make the pages look visually pleasing.

In this project, I practiced and memorized the HTML boilerplate, practiced adding images into the web page using the 'img' element and 'src' attribute. Practiced adding links to my web page using the 'a' element, and 'href' attribute. Practiced also on structuring the web page using ordered 'ol' and unordered 'ul' lists. Added bold text using 'strong' and italicized text using 'em'. 

All in all, this project was a good mini project to reinforce what I've learned in the foundations section so far, and applied all of the beginner HTML knowledge I've gained.
