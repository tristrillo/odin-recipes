        <h3>What is Chicken Pandan?</h3>
          <p>Chicken Pandan is a delicious <strong>Thai</strong> chicken dish, where marinated chicken pieces are wrapped in screwpine leaves.</p>
          <p><em>What came first, the Chicken or the Egg? I don't care, I eat both!</em></p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
          <ul>
            <li>500g (1 lb) chicken thigh or breast fillets, cut into 20 bite-sized pieces</li>
            <li>20 pandan leaves</li>
            <li>20 toothpicks</li>
            <li>vegetable oil for deep frying</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Marinade</h4>
          <ul>
            <li type="square">6 garlic cloves</li>
            <li type="square">1 tsp whole white peppercorns</li>
            <li type="square">3 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
            <li type="square">½ tsp white sugar</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Dipping Sauce</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>3 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tbsp sweet dark soy sauce</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>  
          <ol>
            <li>To make the marinade, use a mortar and pestle to pound the garlic and peppercorns to a rough paste. Mix the paste with the oyster sauce and sugar. Add the marinade to the chicken and mix until well combined. Wrap each piece of chicken with a pandan leaf. Secure with a toothpick. Chicken can be marinated and wrapped up to a day in advance.</li>
            <li>To make the dipping sauce, combine the ingredients in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Simmer for 4-5 minutes or until thickened slightly. Pour into a small serving bowl (sauce will thicken more as it cools).</li>
            <li>Fill a saucepan or wok to about 1/3 capacity with the vegetable oil. Heat over high heat. The oil is hot enough at 165°C/325°F or when a wooden spoon dipped into the oil forms small little bubbles.</li>
            <li>Fry the chicken pieces in batches in the hot oil for 4-5 minutes or until dark golden and cooked through. Drain on paper towel and serve with the dipping sauce.</li>
